A very simple tool for modifying a photo and converting it into a pegboard pattern.

You need to specify:

* A photo in a standard format
* The number of pegboards, their configuration and size. For simplicity, all pegboards must be the same size and the combined shape made by them must be rectangular.    
* The available bead colors.

Based on this information, the program will generate a pattern and give a list of the number of beads you need in each color.
